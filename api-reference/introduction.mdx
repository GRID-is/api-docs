GRID's API enables you to use your data in a powerful spreadsheet engine, fully compatible with Excel and Google Sheets, and transform your spreadsheets into RESTful APIs.

## Key features

- **Workbook querying**: read and write values from cells, automatically recalculating dependent cells
- **Chart rendering**: generate charts (PNG or SVG) from spreadsheet data with customizable chart types (line and column)
- **Export scenarios**: apply values to cells and download the updated spreadsheet
- **Goal seek operations**: execute goal-seek operations to determine the solution of a target cell by modifying a control cell
- **Stateless**: recalculations without permanent writes
