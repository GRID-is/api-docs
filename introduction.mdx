# Introduction to GRID API

The **GRID API** (`grid.is`) provides a powerful interface for building and managing dynamic data grids with ease. Whether you're handling structured data, performing real-time updates, or integrating with other APIs, GRID simplifies the process.

## Why Use GRID?
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Supports custom configurations and extensions.
- **Real-time Updates**: Sync data changes dynamically.
- **Easy Integration**: REST and GraphQL endpoints available.

## Getting Started

To begin using GRID API, sign up at [grid.is](https://grid.is) and obtain an API key.

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.grid.is/v1/tables" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "tables": [
    { "id": "123", "name": "Users", "rows": 1000 },
    { "id": "456", "name": "Orders", "rows": 500 }
  ]
}
```
