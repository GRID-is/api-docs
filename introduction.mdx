# Introduction to GRID API

GRID's **advanced spreadsheet engine** converts your spreadsheets into flexible, cloud-based web services, making structured data easily accessible via API. Fully compatible with **Excel and Google Sheets**, GRID brings the familiarity of traditional spreadsheets into a **modern, cloud-native environment**.

## Key Features
- **RESTful API** – Easily integrate spreadsheet logic into applications without rebuilding complex calculations.
- **Stateless API** – Multiple user sessions can interact with the spreadsheet without altering its underlying values.
- **Dynamic Queries** – Retrieve calculations and data in real-time based on supplied parameters.
- **Generate Visuals** – API endpoints support visualization generation from spreadsheet data.
- **Download with State** – Supply query parameters to export a modified version of the spreadsheet with applied values.

With GRID's **RESTful API**, developers can **automate workflows, process large-scale data computations, and integrate spreadsheet-driven logic** into existing systems. This approach enhances reliability, accelerates development, and ensures that spreadsheet models remain consistent and accurate across different environments.
